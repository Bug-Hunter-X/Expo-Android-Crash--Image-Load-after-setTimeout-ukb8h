This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in an Expo app where loading an image from a remote URL after a simulated loading delay using `setTimeout` causes a crash on Android but not iOS. The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code, and the `bugSolution.js` file presents a potential solution to this issue.  The core problem appears to be related to how Expo's image loading mechanism interacts with asynchronous operations and the Android runtime environment. This issue highlights the need for robust error handling when dealing with asynchronous image loading in Expo apps.
